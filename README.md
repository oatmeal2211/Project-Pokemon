# Project-Pokemon
## Project Description
Welcome to our project about Project Pokemon! This project was created for the purpose of completing the course WIA1002 Data Structures. This repository will be used as the main folder of our project and be used for version control throughout the entire project. Below is a list of guidelines to follow while using this repository.
## Guidelines & Help Zone
### Github Basics
[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-git-and-github/) is a website for how to use git and github. You do not have to create your own repository because I've already created this one for everyone to use. Most of the useful information can be found after Step 6.
### ALWAYS CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCHHHHHH
**NEVER EVERR write your code onto the main branch.** This is to prevent any issues with the main code and to be used as the main restart point if code made on your branch doesn't work and you want to restart. All code must be done on your own branch to be used as your own copy of the main branch code. Once again, **NEVER EDIT THE MAIN CODE**.
### Always inform when you merge your branch
Sometimes everyone wants to review your code before you push to main branch. This, once again, is to prevent from any issues to the main code as other users will be pulling from it. Before you push anything to the main branch, please inform the team so that everyone is ok with your code pushing to main.
### Use VSCode
Makes it easier for you and everyone else. Especially when it comes to merge conflicts. Trust me.
### Merge conflicts
No matter what happens in a project, merge conflicts will always occur. ~~So instead of deleting the entire fking git repo~~ We can resolve these conflicts simply by using the github's built in functions to resolve by using a pull request. You can read up more on how to resolve merge conflicts [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github). 

In the event that the resolve conflict button doesn't appear on the screen, that means your code is too complex for github to resolve the merge conflict. You would have to check the merge conflict issue in your compiler itself and solve it there manually. Sometimes there would be some lines of code that are accidentally deleted when you manually resolve, so please double check before you officially push the final code.

If there are any issues with merge conflicts, please tell @oatmeal2211 to help solve it ~~or we die~~.
